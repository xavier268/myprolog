# myprolog
A Prolog (the langage) implementation for educational purposes

# work in progress

* change VarIsNumber into smaller number/integer constraints
* find a way to handle diff
    * do we need constraints, or can we handle it as predicate only ?
    * if diff constraints, can we have a single constraint, capitalising on any other constraint(s)
